# The java offline buildpack has a `resources/cache` dir while the
# rest have a `dependencies` one.
#
# ATTENTION, the `dependencies` directory is expected to be in the
# toplevel directory of the buildpack. Not deeper in the hierarchy.
#
# This means that a directory like
# `vendor/bundle/ruby/2.6.0/gems/activesupport-4.2.11.1/lib/active_support/dependencies`
# as found in the online PHP buildpack does NOT count.
#
# This is achieved by explicitly iterating over the buildpacks and
# testing for the problematic directories.
